    <li>Node js</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Node js is a operating System. </li>
        <li>Node.js is an open source platform.</li>
        <li>node js is a runtime environment that run on Chrome 's V8 Engine.</li>
        <li>Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment.</li>
<br>
<li>What is the role of Node.js in React-Native?</li>
   <ul>
    <li>
        React Native uses Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, to build your JavaScript code.
    </li>
    <li>
        React Native ships with some tools that are written for Node.js.
    </li>
    <li>it offers a way to easily build fast, scalable programs.</li>
    <li>
         Node.js allows you to run JavaScript in Terminal, and helps create modules.
    </li>
   </ul> 
   <br>
    <li>npm = node package manager</li>
    <ul>
        <li> It is a Javascript package manager and the default package manager for Node projects.</li>
        <li>NPM is installed when NodeJS is installed on a machine.</li> 
        <li>It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM.</li> 
        <li>This database is called the NPM Registry, and it hosts public and private 'packages.'</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>npx = node package execute</li>
    <ul>
        <li> It is simply an NPM package runner.</li>
        <li>It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it.</li> 
        <li>NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.</li>
    </ul>
        
         
        <br>
     <li>differenet between in npm and npx:-</li>
     
     <ul>
        <li>
            NPM is a package manager used to install, delete, and update Javascript packages on your machine.	
       <br> NPX is a package executer, and it is used to execute javascript packages directly, without installing them
       </li>
       <li>
        Npm is a tool that use to install packages.	<br> 
        Npx is a tool that use to execute packages.
       </li>
       <li>
        Packages used by npm are installed globally. You have to care about pollution in the long term.	 <br>
        Packages used by npx are not installed globally. You donot have to worry about for pollution in the long term.
       </li>
     </ul>
    
</ul>
    <li>React Native</li>
    <ul>
        <li>application use start= npx react-native start.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>r - reload the app</li>
            <li> d - open developer menu</li>
            <li>i - run on iOS</li>
            <li> a - run on Android</li>
         </ul>

   <br>
    <li>appliction use ios emulater  =  npx react-native run-ios</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            npx react-native run-ios is one way to run your app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode.
        </li>
    </ul>
  
    <br>
    <li>appliction use android emulater = npx react-native run-android -- --warning-mode=all - android</li>

<br>
   <li>React Fundamentals</li>    
   <ul>
    <li>
        React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. 
    </li>
    <li>core concepts behind React:</li>
    <ol>
    <li>components :-</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Components are independent and reusable code.</li>
        <li>They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in Secure space and return HTML.</li>
        <li>Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.</li></li>
      <br>
    
        <ul>
            <li>
Functional Components — functions that return JSX. Can do more stuff with React Hooks.</li>
<li>
Class Components — classes that can manipulate state, props, and lifecycle methods.
</li>
<li>
Pure Components — functional components that performs shouldComponentUpdate() automatically.
 Re-renders only if state or props is different from previous state or props.
</li>
<li>
Higher-Order Components — functions that return one or multiple components, depending on array data.
</li>
      </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <li>JSX :- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.</li>
    <li>props :-</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Props are arguments passed into React components.</li>

          <li> Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>state</li>
   </ol>
   </ul>
   <br>
<li> TextInput style={{}} =  Style tage ne html object banave 6 </li>

<br>
<li>When two objects are created in ract-native, and in case of keys are same of first object and second object, you will get output of second object key 
</li>
</ul>
