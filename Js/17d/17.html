    <p>promise</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We human give or receive a promise to do some activity at some point in time.</li>
           <li> If we keep the promise we make others happy but if we do not keep the promise, it may lead discontentment. </li>
      <li>A Promise is a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. </li>
       <li> It allows handler with an asynchronous actions eventual success value or failure reason.
    </li>
      <li>  This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.</li>
      
    <li>A Promise is in one of these states:</li>
     <ul>
        <li> pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    </li>
    <li>fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
    </li>
    <li>rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
    </li>
</ul>
        </li></ul>
    <p>callbacks</p>
    <ul><li>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function</li>
        <li>   A callback function can run after another function has finished</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Promise constructor:-</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We can create a new promise using the key word new followed by the word Promise and followed by a parenthesis.</li>
                <li> Inside the parenthesis, it takes a callback function. The promise callback function has two parameters which are the resolve and reject functions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Fetch Api :- </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Fetch API accesses resources across the network.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>await()</p>
    <ul>
        <li>wait works inside async functions.</li>
        <li>Makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>clouser</li>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript allows writing function inside an outer function. We can write as many inner functions as we want. If inner function access the variables of outer function then it is called closure.</li>
    <li>function in th function</li>
    </ul>
